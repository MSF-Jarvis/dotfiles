# lazy-bash

Collection of little bash hacks and utilities I use frequently

 - functions.bash -- `source functions.bash` from your bashrc or bash_profiles and utilise the nifty functions in the script.

 - build-XOS.sh -- A build script geared towards unattended builds of [halogenOS](https://github.com/halogenOS) utilising the [Telegram](https://telegram.org/) bot [API](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api) for notifying the user about current build status.
